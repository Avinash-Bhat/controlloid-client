Controlloid is a small open source application that turns your phone into a
real game controller for your PC. It works on Linux and Windows and can
connect through anything that allows the creation of a LAN network: WiFi,
Bluetooth, USB etc. It works over internet too, but for optimal performance
it is recommended to create a hotspot on your PC and disable other network
connections (such as wired) which allows the connected devices to access
the internet.
